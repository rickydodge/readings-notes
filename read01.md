Overview
Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

Markdown	HTML	Rendered Output
# Heading level 1	<h1>Heading level 1</h1>	
Heading level 1
## Heading level 2	<h2>Heading level 2</h2>	
Heading level 2
### Heading level 3	<h3>Heading level 3</h3>	
Heading level 3

Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Line Breaks
To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.	<p>This is the first line.<br>
And this is the second line.</p>	
This is the first line.
And this is the second line.

Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

Markdown	HTML	Rendered Output
I just love **bold text**.	I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.	I just love bold text.
I just love __bold text__.	I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.	I just love bold text.
Love**is**bold	Love<strong>is</strong>bold	Loveisbold

Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

Markdown	HTML	Rendered Output
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.	Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.	Italicized text is the cat’s meow.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.	Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.	Italicized text is the cat’s meow.
A*cat*meow	A<em>cat</em>meow	Acatmeow

Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
The rendered output looks like this:

Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

URLs and Email Addresses
To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>
The rendered output looks like this:

https://www.markdownguide.org
fake@example.com

Images
To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.

![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")
