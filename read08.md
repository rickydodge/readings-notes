Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JavaScript attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically. The sole exceptions to type conversion within comparisons involve the === and !== operators, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons. These operators do not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before checking equality. The following table describes the comparison operators in terms of this sample code:

const var1 = 3;
const var2 = 4;

Comparison operators
Operator	Description	Examples returning true
Equal (==)	Returns true if the operands are equal.	3 == var1
"3" == var1

3 == '3'
Not equal (!=)	Returns true if the operands are not equal.	var1 != 4
var2 != "3"
Strict equal (===)	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. See also Object.is and sameness in JS.	3 === var1
Strict not equal (!==)	Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.	var1 !== "3"
3 !== '3'
Greater than (>)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	var2 > var1
"12" > 2
Greater than or equal (>=)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.	var2 >= var1
var1 >= 3
Less than (<)	Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.	var1 < var2
"2" < 12
Less than or equal (<=)	Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.	var1 <= var2
var2 <= 5

Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations listed in the following table:

Name	Shorthand operator	Meaning
Assignment	x = f()	x = f()
Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
Division assignment	x /= f()	x = x / f()
Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()
Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	x = x ** f()
Left shift assignment	x <<= f()	x = x << f()
Right shift assignment	x >>= f()	x = x >> f()
Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= f()	x = x >>> f()
Bitwise AND assignment	x &= f()	x = x & f()
Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= f()	x = x ^ f()
Bitwise OR assignment	x |= f()	x = x | f()
Logical AND assignment	x &&= f()	x && (x = f())
Logical OR assignment	x ||= f()	x || (x = f())
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= f()	x ?? (x = f())

Loops and iteration

for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

When a for loop executes, the following occurs:

The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the conditionExpression expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.
If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
Control returns to Step 2.
Example
In the example below, the function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected options in a scrolling list (a <select> element that allows multiple selections).

HTML
<form name="selectForm">
  <label for="musicTypes">Choose some music types, then click the button below:</label>
  <select id="musicTypes" name="musicTypes" multiple>
    <option selected>R&B</option>
    <option>Jazz</option>
    <option>Blues</option>
    <option>New Age</option>
    <option>Classical</option>
    <option>Opera</option>
  </select>
  <button id="btn" type="button">How many are selected?</button>
</form>

JavaScript
Here, the for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to 0. It checks that i is less than the number of options in the <select> element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop.

function howMany(selectObject) {
  let numberSelected = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < selectObject.options.length; i++) {
    if (selectObject.options[i].selected) {
      numberSelected++;
    }
  }
  return numberSelected;
}

const btn = document.getElementById('btn');

btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const musicTypes = document.selectForm.musicTypes;
  console.log(`You have selected ${howMany(musicTypes)} option(s).`);
});

while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement
Copy to Clipboard
If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.

Example 1
The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3:

let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
Copy to Clipboard
With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:

After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

Example 2
Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes falseâ€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:

// Infinite loops are bad!
while (true) {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
