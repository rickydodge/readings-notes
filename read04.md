An introduction to wireframing
1. What is a wireframe?
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code—whether that’s a developer coding it, or you the designer. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface. A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used. A button or call to action needs to be clear to the user even it’s not brightly colored and flashing.

2. Wireframe examples
Before you start designing the wireframes of your own app or product, take a look at some examples of wireframes. This will give you some inspiration for your own wireframes, as well as giving you an idea of the variety of ways of creating them. Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create theirs. We’ll go through some of the tools you can use to create wireframes shortly, but it’s important to emphasize that how you make yours is up to you: some people feel more creative when sat at their computer, while others prefer to have a pen and paper in hand.

That said, for complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:

Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.
It’s likely to be to your advantage to start off hand-drawing your wireframes before executing more detailed versions using an online app or software. The following wireframes should give you a good idea of how information can be organized on the screen.

3. Things to consider before you start wireframing
As we mentioned above, different UX designers approach the task of wireframing in different ways. Some like to draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online. But more often than not, the decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires. It depends largely on how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what is being designed.

Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
Sketch > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
If the task is very narrow and the visual design is either set or considered unimportant (such as with many backend administrative interfaces), then going from a sketch to coding/development makes sense, whereas if the time and resources and the business value are all high, then spending the time to make a high-definition wireframe and going through a cycle of testing with a fully realized interactive prototype makes better sense.

4. The best tools for wireframing
There are heaps of free wireframe tools out there, so you should experiment with as many as you can to find the ones that suit you the best. Don’t forget that you can also just use pen and paper! Below we’ve listed three online tools we find particularly good. The examples below all have free trials, so check them out!

UXPin: UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive, clickable prototypes directly in your browser.

InVision: InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!

Wireframe.cc: Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.

6 Steps to make a wireframe
1. Do your research
Remember: UX design is a process, and wireframing isn’t the first step in this process. Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, creating user personas and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research. What does that mean? That means carrying out analysis of similar product lines to your own, digging into prevailing UX trends and best practises, and, of course, reviewing your own internal design guidelines.

And if you’re designing a new feature, don’t be afraid to research outside of your domain. Introducing tracking and data visualization as part of your logistics company’s service? Perhaps it’s worth checking out some fitness or nutrition apps on Dribbble or Behance for some ideas. Creativity is often set loose at point where fields of expertise intersect, after all.

Unsure what user research is and why it’s very, very important? Let us explain.

2. Prepare your research for quick reference
You can imagine how much quantitative and qualitative data those various phases will produce. Well, that’s what you need to keep in mind while drawing out your wireframes. If you’re a mere mortal, you might struggle to both retain and recall all of that, so I recommend scribbling a cheatsheet with your business and user goals (your requirements), your personas, use cases, and perhaps some reminders of the coolest features you stumbled across in your competitor research. A few choice quotes from your audience might also help focus your attention on the user’s experience, which is—never forget—what you’re designing!

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
Your wireframing is going to get very messy very quickly if you don’t have an idea of how many screens you’ll need to produce and the flow you expect the user to follow. It’s important to have a watertight concept of where your users will be coming from (which marketing channel, for example, and off the back of what messaging), and where you need them to end up. If you’re already well-acquainted with UX vocabulary, your internal voice will be alternately screaming “user flows” and “information architecture”.

Good information architecture will ensure that your users are self-sufficient (fewer messages to your customer service asking how to do something painfully simple), lower levels of user frustration (and ultimately more satisfaction and trust), and therefore lower drop-off or drop-out rates. Which probably means more revenue, and probably means happy managers—and a job well done.

Don’t know what Information Architecture is? We’ve got that covered for you too.

4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
Ok, now we’re on step four and you can finally start putting pen to paper. Sorry it’s taken this long, but the previous steps were critical: The old adage that you should look before you leap is 100% relevant to UX.

Anyway, let’s get some wires on your frame. Remember: you’re outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating in mighty fine detail. There’s nothing worse than a blank piece of paper, so you need to start getting your ideas down pronto—that’s the imperative for step three. Don’t think about aesthetics, don’t think about colors—the UI designer can deal with that. And if you’re the only designer at your fledgling startup… well, just do it later.

A good, thick marker pen (a Sharpie, as our friends in the US call them) is a handy tool for this stage of wireframing. Why? Because it prevents you from drowning yourself in detail. You’ll focus on delineating the functional blocks that form the skeleton of your design. As Jeff suggests in the video above, pose yourself the following three questions while you’re sketching:

How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?
Once you have a few variations of your first screens, you might want to do a bit of collaborative wireframing with a fellow designer or product manager. What’s that mean? Simple. Lift your wireframes off the paper and onto a whiteboard, and play around with them. Ask yourself and one another; “Are we creating something usable that meets our audience’s needs?”

5. Add some detail and get testing
So you have a flow and you have your screens, and you’ve corroborated your ideas with some clued-up colleagues. The next step is to add some informational details to prepare your wireframe for its upgrade, Megatron-style, to prototype-mode.

Add detail in the way you would naturally process a screen, or the page of a book: from top-to-bottom and left-to-right. Remember: Your wireframe is the skeleton of your site. You’re not adding the muscle just yet—the content and the copy. To extend the metaphor somewhat uncomfortably, these elements are the ligaments and tendons that will connect form and functionality. Think about the following:

Usability conventions, such as putting the navigation at the top next to your logo, having a search box on the top right, and so on
Simple, instructional wording for i.e. calls-to-action
Trust-building elements: What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would be the best place to put these elements?
Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
Once you’ve done all that, you’re ready for your first user tests. At this stage, your users may well be your colleagues. Indeed, one of the joys of the humble wireframe is that it serves as a common language between designers, stakeholders and web and app developers. You can use tools like UsabilityHub to preference test screens and collect qualitative feedback, and Prott to test and check understanding of the basic user flow. With this tool, you can simply photograph and upload your hand-sketched wireframes, and then connect them to user button overlays. Clever stuff!

Know nothing about Usability Testing? Here’s a guide for beginners.

6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
Once you’ve documented and acted upon the feedback from your first prototype, you can start developing your high-fidelity prototypes. There are lots of slick tools out there for this, from Proto.io to Adobe XD and Framer, but the most well-known are Sketch and the browser-based, new(ish) kid-on-the-block, Figma. Once you’ve developed your wireframes in Sketch, you can import them into the industry-leading prototyping tool InVision (which, incidentally, we built a course in conjunction with) and interlink your screens for a second round of high-fidelity user testing. It’s at this point that we’ve most certainly crossed from wireframing to prototyping. To find out more about that, you’ll have to read another article.

Let’s summarize by reviewing three key principles to keep in mind when you’re producing your wireframe.

Collaborative wireframing between a UX designer and a product manager
How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles
The following points should be at the forefront of your mind when building your wireframe:

1. Clarity
Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.

2. Confidence
Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage. Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar–and that’s before you’ve even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles.

3. Simplicity is key
Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

Your wireframe should be a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be navigated. Attractiveness at this stage is not a consideration. Once you’ve decided who your product or service is for, you can begin laying out the information they are looking for in an intuitive and natural way that is not only familiar to them as users of this kind of service, but that also guides them towards the conversion point or otherwise helps them to achieve their goals in the interaction. By presenting your information in this way, you are aligning both the business goals of your site with the needs of the customer.

HTML basics

Anatomy of an HTML element
Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.


The main parts of our element are as follows:

The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.

An attribute should always have the following:

A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
Anatomy of an HTML document
That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
  </body>
</html>
Copy to Clipboard
Here, we have the following:

<!DOCTYPE html> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
<html></html> — the <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
<head></head> — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
<meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.
<title></title> — the <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
<body></body> — the <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
Marking up text
This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.

Headings
Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <h1> - <h6>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:

<!-- 4 heading levels: -->
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>

Paragraphs
As explained above, <p> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:

<p>This is a single paragraph</p>
Copy to Clipboard
Add your sample text (you should have it from What will your website look like?) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your <img> element.

Lists
A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.
Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.

Each item inside the lists is put inside an <li> (list item) element.

For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list

<p>At Mozilla, we're a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together… </p>
Copy to Clipboard
We could modify the markup to this

<p>At Mozilla, we're a global community of</p>

<ul>
  <li>technologists</li>
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ul>

<p>working together… </p>
Copy to Clipboard
Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.

Links
Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:

Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
Wrap the text in an <a> element, as shown below:
<a>Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Copy to Clipboard
Give the <a> element an href attribute, as shown below:
<a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Copy to Clipboard
Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Copy to Clipboard
You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.

Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
Copy to Clipboard
By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an <h1> with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading. Consider the following:

<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Is this a top level heading?</span>
Copy to Clipboard
This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.

Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
